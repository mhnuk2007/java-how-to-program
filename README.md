# Java How To Program - Chapterwise Solutions

This repository contains Java programs, examples, and exercises organized chapter-by-chapter from the book:

**"Java How to Program, Early Objects (10th Edition)" by Paul Deitel and Harvey Deitel**

## Purpose

I’m solving the examples and exercises from the book to:
- Build a strong foundation in Java
- Practice OOP and core programming concepts
- Track chapterwise progress as I learn

## Current Progress

Implemented so far:

- [x] Chapter 2 – Introduction to Java Applications
- [x] Chapter 4 – Control Statements: Part 1
- [ ] Chapter 3 – Classes, Objects, Methods (Coming Soon)
- [ ] Chapter 5+ – Work in progress...

(You can update the list as you complete more chapters.)
