This chapter introduces Java application programming. The application performs simple arithmetic calculations and displays the results. It demonstrates how to obtain input from the user, perform calculations, and display output. Programs begin with a class declaration and contain one or more methods. The main method is the starting point of every Java application. This chapter also discusses how to save, compile, and run programs from the command-line. You'll learn how to instruct the computer to make decisions and perform comparison operations. Later chapters show how to display messages, obtain inputs, and compare numbers. You'll see how programs display the results on the screen and how to use tools from the JDK. Finally, the chapter introduces examples and shows how to learn programming by example.
