# Chapter 5: Control Statements - Part 2 (Logical Operators)

This chapter builds upon previous control structures by introducing additional repetition and decision-making constructs, along with logical operators to create more complex expressions.

---

## ðŸ“š Objectives

In this chapter, youâ€™ll:

- Learn the essentials of **counter-controlled repetition**.
- Use the `for` and `do...while` repetition statements.
- Understand **multiple-selection** using the `switch` statement.
- Alter the flow of control using `break` and `continue`.
- Learn how to form **complex conditional expressions** using **logical operators**.

## ðŸ§  Outline

### 5.1 Introduction

Overview of control flow, program structure, and repetition statements.

### 5.2 Essentials of Counter-Controlled Repetition

Learn how counters are used in loops (initialization, condition, update).

### 5.3 `for` Repetition Statement

Use `for` loops for concise and readable counter-controlled repetition.

### 5.4 Examples Using the `for` Statement

Practice problems demonstrating real-world use of `for`.

### 5.5 `do...while` Repetition Statement

Understand how `do...while` ensures at least one execution.

### 5.6 `switch` Multiple-Selection Statement

Handle multiple conditions more clearly using `switch`.

### 5.7 Case Study: AutoPolicy with `switch` and Strings

Understand how `switch` works with `String` values.

### 5.8 `break` and `continue` Statements

Control loop flow using `break` and `continue`.

### 5.9 Logical Operators

Learn how `&&`, `||`, and `!` help create compound conditions.

### 5.10 Structured Programming Summary

Summary of all control statements and best practices.

### 5.11 (Optional) GUI & Graphics Case Study

Visual representation using GUI to draw rectangles and ovals.

## âœ… Practice Focus

- `for`, `do...while`, `switch`, `break`, `continue`
- Logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`
- Writing readable and structured loops
- Nested and compound conditional expressions

---

## ðŸ›  Sample Programs

- Print patterns using `for`
- Input validation using `do...while`
- Menu-based programs using `switch`
- Filtering and decision-making with logical operators
- Loop control using `break` and `continue`

---

## ðŸš€ Keep Practicing

Challenge yourself to:

- Refactor `if-else` ladders to `switch`
- Combine loops and logical operators
- Build mini console apps (e.g., calculator menu)

Happy coding! ðŸ’»âœ¨
