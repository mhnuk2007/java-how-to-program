    5.16 (Bar Chart Printing Program) One interesting application of computers is to
    display graphs and bar charts. Write an application that reads five numbers between 1
    and 30. For each number thatâ€™s read, your program should display the same number of
    adjacent asterisks. For example, if your program reads the number 7, it should
    display *******. Display the bars of asterisks after you read all five numbers.
