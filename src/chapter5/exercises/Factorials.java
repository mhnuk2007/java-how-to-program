    5.13 (Factorials) Factorials are used frequently in probability problems. The factorial of a
    positive integer n (written n! and pronounced “n factorial”) is equal to the product
    of the positive integers from 1 to n. Write an application that calculates the factorials
    of 1 through 20. Use type long. Display the results in tabular format. What difficulty
    might prevent you from calculating the factorial of 100?
