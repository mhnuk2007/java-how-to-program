# Chapter 4: Control Statements Part 1, Assignment, ++ and -- Operators

This chapter focuses on essential control flow concepts in Java, teaching how to guide program execution based on conditions and loops. It introduces techniques like algorithm design, decision-making with `if` and `if-else`, and repetition with `while` loops. This foundation is critical for solving real-world problems and building interactive programs.

## âœ… Chapter Objectives

- Understand basic problem-solving and algorithm development.
- Write structured pseudocode to plan programs.
- Use selection statements (`if`, `if-else`) for decision-making.
- Use the `while` loop for repetition (iteration).
- Implement counter-controlled and sentinel-controlled loops.
- Use compound assignment operators (like `+=`, `-=`, etc.).
- Use increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators effectively.
- Understand the portability and behavior of Java primitive types.

- Executes one block if true, another if false.

### 4.7 Nested `if...else` and the Conditional (`?:`) Operator
- Handling multiple conditions and simplifying `if-else` using ternary operator.

### 4.8 `while` Loop (Repetition Statement)
- Executes a block while a condition is true.

### 4.9 Counter-Controlled Repetition
- Looping a fixed number of times using a control variable.

### 4.10 Sentinel-Controlled Repetition
- Looping based on user input until a sentinel value is reached.

- Prefix vs postfix increment (`++var`, `var++`) and decrement (`--var`, `var--`).

### 4.14 Primitive Types and Portability
- Javaâ€™s strongly typed system and how types like `int`, `double`, `char` behave across platforms.
