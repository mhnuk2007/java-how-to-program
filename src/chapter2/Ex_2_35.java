    2.35 (Car-Pool Savings Calculator) Research several car-pooling websites. Create an
    application that calculates your daily driving cost, so that you can estimate how
    much money could be saved by car pooling, which also has other advantages such as
    reducing carbon emissions and reducing traffic congestion. The application should
    input the following information and display the userâ€™s cost per day of driving to work:
        a) Total miles driven per day.
        b) Cost per gallon of gasoline.
        c) Average miles per gallon.
        d) Parking fees per day.
        e) Tolls per day.
