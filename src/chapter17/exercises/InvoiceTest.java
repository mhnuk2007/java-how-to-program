Exercise: 17.11
Given an array of Invoice objects with fields: part number, part description, quantity, and price:
    a. How can you sort the invoices by part description using streams and lambdas?
    b. How can you sort the invoices by price?
    c. How can you map each invoice to its part description and quantity, then sort by quantity?
    d. How can you map each invoice to its part description and invoice value (quantity Ã— price), then sort by invoice value?
    e. How can you filter the results from part (4) to show only invoice values between $200 and $500?
