    6.8 (Parking Charges) A parking garage charges a $2.00 minimum fee to park for up to
    three hours. The garage charges an additional $0.50 per hour for each hour or part thereof
    in excess of three hours. The maximum charge for any given 24-hour period is $10.00.
    Assume that no car parks for longer than 24 hours at a time. Write an application that
    calculates and displays the parking charges for each customer who parked in the garage
    yesterday. You should enter the hours parked for each customer. The program should display
    the charge for the current customer and should calculate and display the running total
    of yesterdayâ€™s receipts. It should use the method calculateCharges to determine the
    charge for each customer.
