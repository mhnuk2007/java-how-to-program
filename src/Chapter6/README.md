# Chapter 6 – Methods: A Deeper Look

This folder contains Java programs and exercises based on **Chapter 6: Methods—A Deeper Look** from the book *Java How to Program Early Objects (10th Edition)* by Paul and Harvey Deitel.

## 📚 Chapter Objectives

In this chapter, I explored:

- ✅ Static methods and fields associated with classes
- ✅ The method-call/return mechanism and the call stack
- ✅ Argument promotion and type casting
- ✅ Organizing classes using Java packages
- ✅ Using secure random number generation for game-like applications
- ✅ Understanding scope and visibility of declarations
- ✅ Method overloading and how to use it effectively
- ✅ (Optional) GUI and graphics using colors and filled shapes

## 💡 Key Concepts

- **Static Members**: Belong to the class, not instances.
- **Math Class**: Provides static utility methods (e.g., `Math.sqrt`, `Math.pow`, `Math.random`).
- **Method Overloading**: Methods with the same name but different parameter lists.
- **Call Stack**: Supports nested method calls and stack frames.
- **Scope**: Visibility of variables and methods within blocks.
- **SecureRandom**: For better randomness in games and simulations.
- **Argument Promotion**: Automatic type conversions during method calls.
- **Packages**: Organize and reuse classes.

## 📁 Structure

Each Java file is named to reflect the concept or exercise it implements, for example:

- `MathTest.java` – Demonstrates usage of `Math` class static methods.
- `RandomGame.java` – Implements a game using `SecureRandom`.
- `OverloadedMethods.java` – Shows method overloading in action.
- `ScopeDemo.java` – Explains variable scope with examples.

## 📌 Notes

- Used `toString()` and string concatenation techniques.
- Practiced modular coding using methods and parameter lists.
- Understood how stack overflow errors occur through deep recursion.
