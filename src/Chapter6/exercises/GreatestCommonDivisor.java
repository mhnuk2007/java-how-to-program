    6.27 (Greatest Common Divisor) The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers is
    the largest integer that evenly divides each of the two numbers. Write a method gcd
    that returns the greatest common divisor of two integers. [Hint: You might want to
    use Euclidâ€™s algorithm. You can find information about it at
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm.] Incorporate the method into an application
    that reads two values from the user and displays the result.
